# Fitness App

Hypothetical fitness application that would send a different workout every week as well as a small Rust API to deal with asynchronous data loading. This is my first ever Flutter app that I built to learn the framework. All the labels are in french because I did not deal with i8n back then and never bothered doing it afterward.
